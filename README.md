# PB2
Code for the Population-Based Bandits Algorithm

The framework is based on a union of [ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) (using rllib and tune) and [GPy](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy)

This is currently a work in progress. The code will be regularly updated during June/July 2020.

Please get in touch for all questions.
